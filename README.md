ðŸ“§ Email Reminder Setup

This document explains how to set up and use the Email Reminder Worker in this project so patients receive appointment reminders with the App/Clinic name as the sender.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure nodemailer, luxon, and node-cron are installed in the backend.

These handle email sending, time management, and scheduling.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Configure Environment Variables

Inside your .env file, add the following values:

EMAIL_HOST â†’ Your SMTP provider (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)

EMAIL_PORT â†’ Usually 465 (secure) or 587 (TLS)

EMAIL_USER â†’ The email address youâ€™ll send from

EMAIL_PASS â†’ App password (not your personal password)

EMAIL_FROM â†’ How the sender name appears (e.g. Doctor Clinic <yourappemail@example.com>)

This ensures emails come from your App/Clinic name, not a random Gmail username.

ðŸ”¹ 3. How the Worker Runs

The Email Reminder Worker checks todayâ€™s appointments.

If a patient has an appointment, theyâ€™ll receive a reminder email.

The sender line will show your App/Clinic name.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Scheduling Options

By default, reminders run at 08:00 AM every day.

You can change the schedule using cron expressions.

Example: every hour, or once daily in the morning.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Manual Testing

Thereâ€™s a test endpoint (/test-reminder) available.

Visiting it will trigger the reminder worker immediately.

Use this to confirm emails are working before going live.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Deployment Notes

For production, use a domain email (info@yourclinic.com) for professional branding instead of a Gmail.

Make sure your hosting allows outbound SMTP connections.
